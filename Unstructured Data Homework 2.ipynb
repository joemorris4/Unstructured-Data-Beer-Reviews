Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish.   M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.  O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now.\n",
